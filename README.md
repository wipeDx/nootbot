# NootBot #
NootBot is a Discord-bot which is built on [DV8FRomTheWorld's JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).
It aims to make the life of our group easier. You can deploy it for your own group or guild!

The voice commands are based on [sedmelluq's LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/LavaPlayer).

### How do I get set up? ###

* Nootbot runs wherever there's a Java Runtime Environment with at least Version 8
* Just need to run it, it creates the config itself interactively.
* Note that this is a WIP and I still need to figure that out. I guess I'll provide a .jar or sth like that

### Who do I talk to if something goes wrong? ###

* Just me, wipeD. You can find me on Discord (wipeD#1889) or via E-Mail. I'm sure you'll find that somewhere.
* Create an issue on here
